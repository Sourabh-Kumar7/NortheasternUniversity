## Assignment Description

The objective of this assignment is to get familiar with Java classes, objects, Swing framework classes, and event processing. In addition, you will learn how to move data back and forth between objects and Java Swing forms.

### Assignment Tasks

1. **Create Person Button**
   - Fills a person object with 10 attributes specific to a person, such as name, SSN, website URL, email, picture, etc.

2. **Create Address**
   - Fills an address object with location info, including GPS location, city, state, and country.

3. **Create Driver Button**
   - Fills a Driver object with a driver's license.

4. **Create Vehicle Registration Button**
   - Fills a Vehicle Registration object with car info (model, serial, etc.).

5. **Create Patient Button**
   - Fills a Patient object with 5 attributes specific to patients, such as patient ID, primary doctor, date of last visit to the doctor, date of next appointment, allergies ("yes" or "no"), on medication ("yes" or "no"), insurance coverage, etc. Personal info is kept in the person object.

6. **Create Doctor**
   - Fills a doctor object with doctor's professional info, such as name, office address, doctor ID, specialty, etc. Must use at least 7 attributes specific to a medical doctor.

7. **Create Insurance Coverage**
   - Fills an insurance object with attributes specific to a health insurance company, such as their corporate ID number, address, premium (yearly payment for coverage), deductible (what the patient has to pay), and a text statement of the benefits (text area).

8. **Display Report (Button)**
   - This button will generate a report form (a single form) that displays all the attributes created above in a meaningful format describing all the objects. Attractive layouts, colors, and proper alignments should be used as much as possible. Make sure to group things in logical units that are easy to understand by an end user reviewing the report.
   - Print a similar report in the NetBeans output window using `System.println()`.
